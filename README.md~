##  <div align="center"> Open-source Inversion recovery myocardial T1 mapping sequence

<div align="justify"> Quantitative MR methods require reproducibility studies to evaluate their accuracy and precision which can be difficult when MR sequences can vary between centers and scanners. In addition, faster prototyping for concept testing and improvement is challenging and time consuming.</div>

<br/>

This package offers an open-source Prototype of Myocardial T1 mapping (ProMyoT1) using Pulseq [[1]](#references) which includes an inversion recovery T1 mapping sequence with a triggering scheme. ProMyoT1 accessibility allows faster implementation of new ideas, while its applicability to different vendors though Pulseq versatility makes it an easier route for reproducibility studies.
